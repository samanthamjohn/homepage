summary: "A non-religious religious tradition started in Puerto Rico. It's as weird as it sounds. But also wonderful."

During quarantine, we all got some weird hobbies. Some of us learned how to bake bread. Others learned a foreign language. 

I moved into a community house in Puerto Rico and helped start a church. 

This might sound crazy, but I promise it’s not. 

Churcha Chironja is a space each week to spend time with a community pondering the larger questions in life. It’s about stepping back from your day-to-day problems and thinking longer-term and bigger picture. You don’t need to worship a particular god or believe a doctrine to participate in our version of church. Our sermons have more questions than answers. But by creating this space every week, we made meaningful connections with our community and ourselves. 

# How it works
Every Sunday, we gather over a meal followed by a “sermon,” a short talk about a life topic that has challenged the speaker. Personal stories and quotes from books are encouraged. Then we have a conversation where folks react to the sermon share their stories on the same theme. 

Because every good event needs a good ending, we end church with a poem. The speaker starts with the first word, and then the poem travels around the circle with each person adding one word or punctuation mark. We read the entire poem out loud and send it out to the group as a souvenir to remember it by. 

Usually the sermon is a talk, but in memorable “sermon” the speaker played songs (post-vaccination). Afterwards some of us ended up sitting on the porch singing along to karaoke favorites. In another church, a friend who is usually extremely light-hearted talked about losing their father to alzheimer’s. This sparked a conversation about the power and unreliability of memory. One person had multiple sources disagreeing on whether or not she had a pet donkey as a child! 

The meals have ranged from quick leftover stirfries to elaborate pasta-making endeavors. We were lucky to have a large kitchen. The joy of banding together to roll out five pounds of pasta with water bottles was matched by the daunting task of cleaning all that flour out of the surfaces. The logistics of group meal preparation was a constant challenge and delight.

*Much pasta was made and eaten. We had to get creative finding the right surface to dry it on.*

# How it started
I didn’t grow up religious. On the one hand, I was relieved that I wasn’t forced to wake up early and sit through a boring service every Sunday. But, as I got older, I began to envy the community my friends found through their confirmation classes and youth groups. They went on trips, met boys, and seemed to foster genuine connections across high school social classes--no easy feat. All this was not enough to make me believe in Jesus though. It was a bit too fantastical. 

Fast forward to 2019. I began dating someone who was very religious. As our relationship deepened, I began to join in Sunday church--this was my chance to experience what all the fuss was about! I did not become a Christian. The fantastical elements were still too much for me. But I thoroughly enjoyed the sermons. They were interesting and touched on big life topics. The best part of going to church was to get brunch and talk over the sermon together afterward. Those were the best conversations of the week. I rarely agreed with everything they’d said, but I almost always agreed with *some* of it. And it turns out that when you subtract a belief in Jesus from the equation, there’s still a lot you can get from a sermon. This person and I parted ways in early 2020, and while the church-going might have stuck in other circumstances, the pandemic cut my burgeoning religiosity short for the time. 

In fall 2020, I left New York for the warmer shores of Puerto Rico. At this point, I had almost forgotten about my church experiences. But it was about to come back with a vengeance. I moved into a community, unlike anything I had experienced since college. I would regularly spend time in groups of ten or more people. It was a wild and much-needed departure from my former pandemic life of loneliness. 

One Sunday as my friend Wren and I waited in line for Costco to open, I broached the idea of doing a community version of church minus the God aspect. We quickly became quite enthusiastic about the plan and began brainstorming how we would do it. Our community was already close. It was just a matter of inviting them over for Sunday dinner and sneaking in a sermon. Wren gave the first sermon and set the bar high. We followed the sermon with a conversation about our personal religious journeys and life philosophies. It was one of the best conversations I’d had since arriving nearly a month before.

We continued church each week and had some wonderful conversations with smaller groups of 4-5 people. It was easy to be vulnerable, and our friendships deepened. 

# Growing
As we continued the tradition, challenges began to arise. Each week a new person would present the sermon, and some topics worked better than others. People began including PowerPoints. And while their talks were interesting, they felt more informational than spiritual. 

And the group began to grow. We began to have 10, 15, or even 25 people one week when a former governor of Puerto Rico gave the sermon. The challenges began to mount. With so many people, you didn’t feel as secure and close to everyone. The temptation to show off your smarts would arise while being vulnerable felt farther away. And logistically, it was challenging to get that many people to all sit still and listen to the speaker and one another! 

# What worked
We solved these issues in different ways. The sermon was better when separated from the meal, both in space and time. So we decided to always finish dinner before beginning the sermon portion of the evening. If we didn’t have room to move, we would rearrange the seating area so that folks could put their energy and attention towards the sermon. 

And we learned which sermons worked the best. Powerpoints were banned. I began to write some guidelines for the speakers. Sermons questioning rather than teaching were better (and had the advantage of being easier to do). Having a text was not necessary. Starting with a personal struggle rather than a text led to more authentic and honest sermons. 
I started guiding the conversation more. I’d begin with a short history of churcha chironja so that folks could understand why they were there. And we added conversational guidelines to keep it from veering into a philosophy club or humblebrag session. 

At their best, the sermons taught us things about ourselves and each other. Sometimes in small and unexpected ways. One Sunday I bonded with a newcomer over our hate for food waste and wilingness to eat questionable leftovers rather than throw them out. In another, I had a realization that rearranging furniture, even just a little, is the first step to feeling at home in a place. One friend reported cringing her way through the musical sermon but simultaneously inspired to write her own songs by the end of it. I loved the way that everyone gets something different from it, and that it’s impossible to know what that will be going in.

*Church got big, but we were miraculously still able to have great conversations.*

# What the future holds
This July, I left my community in Puerto Rico. As the world opened up, I had to attend to some travel and family commitments that I could no longer ignore. But the church lives on. It turns out I was not the most critical ingredient to its success. Others have taken over the Puerto Rico branch and the sermons are going strong. 

Even better, the sermons are something that can live in many places. A friend began their own tradition in Oakland. And I plan to continue the tradition with whatever community I find in my travels. While I miss my home church, I am excited to bring in new friends to the practice, and see my friends who have left the island do the same. 


# Post Script: Conversational guidelines
Concrete stories are better than abstract facts or theories. For one thing, obscure and erudite references intimidate people! And, to borrow a quote from my friend Alec, “stories are ideas or concepts crystallized with all the context that makes them something more than a platitude.” The goal is not to share platitudes but rather to bring your whole life and experience to the table so that others can learn from it. Tell the story and let people come to the philosophy themselves. 

Keep your stories personal. Telling about your friend’s struggle tends to cast you in a heroic light and is not as instructive to others. And the more heroic you sound, the harder it is for others to share their own challenging moments. If you follow this, you’ll often leave knowing a lot more about your friends and even more about yourself. 

Be humble--both as the speaker and the audience. This isn’t about things you think you’ve figured out. It’s can sometimes be painfully obvious that you haven’t figured out what you think you have. This is about sharing in the struggle together, not elevating any person above the rest.  

Some people find the poem part stressful. When in doubt use short, concrete words. Plus it's almost impossible for the poem to be bad. Weird, definitely, but never bad.
