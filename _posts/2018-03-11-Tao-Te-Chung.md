I found this Ursula Le Guin translation of the [Tao Te Ching](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/99496/lao-tzu-tao-te-ching-by-ursula-k-le-guin/9781570623950/){:target='_blank'} on the bookshelf at an airbnb. I liked it so much that I bought my own copy.


There are a lot of best parts. One is that Le Guin doesn't even speak Chinese! I also love how perfectly it captures the essence of the negative.
