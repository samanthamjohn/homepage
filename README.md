hosted on netlify
Site generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).


# Quick start
- `bundle install`
- `bundle exec jekyll clean` - Removes all generated files: destination folder, metadata file, Sass and Jekyll caches.
- `jekyll build` or `jekyll b` - Performs a one off build your site to ./_site (by default).
- `jekyll serve` or `jekyll s` - Builds your site any time a source file changes and serves it locally.

# Adding a new post
Make a new file in the `_posts` directory of `src`. Name it with the date (yyyy-mm-dd) and the title. You can copy the format of other posts for guidance.

# Deploy
Push to the master branch on github and netlify will pick up your changes and deploy for you.
